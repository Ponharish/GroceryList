# GroceryList
This project is the second version of a tool I initially developed to create a grocery list.


## How is this project useful?

My family orders groceries once every month. Before developing this project, we manually noted down all the required groceries for the month and sent the list to the shop via message or fax.

To automate this process, I developed the first version of this software in June 2021 using Python and Tkinter. Although it helped speed up the process, it had several drawbacks, such as limited usabilityâ€”the software could only be executed on my laptop due to the required packages.

Now, in July 2024, after gaining significant experience from other projects, I decided to upgrade the system to make it more user-friendly for my family. I upgraded the tech stack to use Django, enabling it to be used as a web application. I also made the monthly grocery list dynamic, allowing groceries for a particular month to be added progressively and printed easily when required. The current application is hosted on Azure cloud, making it accessible to everyone in my family.


## Using the System

This system is designed in a simple and straightforward way:

- **Home Page**: Offers options to create or print a list.
- **Create List**: Allows you to create or amend a list. You can dynamically update the quantity of each grocery item.
- **Print List**: Displays all the groceries for a particular month in a tabular form and allows you to make a PDF copy, which can later be messaged or faxed.

By using this upgraded system, my family can now efficiently manage our monthly grocery orders with ease and convenience.
